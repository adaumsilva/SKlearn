# 🐍 SKlearn - Machine Learning Library Testing 🧪

---

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a **testing and experimentation ground** for various Machine Learning libraries available in Python, with a particular focus on **Scikit-learn (SKlearn)**.

This project aims to:
* Test core functionalities and algorithms provided by SKlearn.
* Develop small, focused examples demonstrating different ML techniques (e.g., classification, regression, clustering).
* Document best practices and common pitfalls when working with these libraries.
